## Restatement of the Problem
Society depends on a diversity of complex networks for its very existence. In our daily life, we use highways, railroads and air transportation network. In the social domain, we are organized by networks like governments, businesses, universities. At more microscale level, people worked in teams to solve complex problem. Although networks are deeply embedded in modern society, knowledge about them is still primitive because of uncertain mechanisms or lack of data.   
  Network science emerged to analyze complex networks and it is widely used in competitive team sports. Soccer is a typical competition sport and is beloved by billions of people in the world. It is also a good example of team network. During the game, 11 team members compete to get the ball inside the other teams goal under laws of the game. Thanks to the modern technology, high-fidelity data streams can be provided. The increasing wealth of data makes soccer game a great entry point to study how people interact with each other in a team and how to improve teamwork efficiency.
